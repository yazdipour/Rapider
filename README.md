##1st Step: C# OCR
https://github.com/yazdipour/Rapider/tree/csharp_ocr

I tried using OCR in C# (Aspose.OCR for .NET).

I wrote a class which helps me to simulate mouse clicks in C#

I try to take screenshot and split it to 70 small images of numbers but Aspose OCR library is too slow to deals with these images.

Problem is Fonts are too small and OCR can not recognize numbers properly.

I thing Iâ€™ve to use OpenCV in python and play with Templates and Sub matrixes.
